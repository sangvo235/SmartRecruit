# Software Required üíª
Before starting please have the following installed.

## Python
- [Python3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Node.js
1. All Platforms:
   - Download the LTS version from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js and npm.
2. Alternatively, use nvm:
   - Install `nvm` (Node Version Manager) from [nvm's GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
   - Install Node.js using nvm with the command `nvm install 20.9`.

## Docker
1. Windows/macOS:
   - Install Docker Desktop from the [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
   - Docker Compose is included in Docker Desktop.
2. Linux:
   - Install Docker using the official guide from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
   - Install Docker Compose separately following the instructions on the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Git (for version control)
1. Windows:
   - Download Git from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
2. macOS:
   - Install Git using Homebrew with the command `brew install git` in the terminal.
   - If you don't have Homebrew, install it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
3. Linux:
   - Use the package manager to install Git, for example `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian/Ubuntu.

## IDE
- Recommended IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## .env files
- Access to the .env.dev file for backend found in the Team's Google Drive.
- Access to the .env.local file for frontend found in the Team's Google Drive.

# Running the Application üë®‚ÄçüöÄ
Follow the following steps to get the application up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

```
git clone git@github.com:sangvo235/SmartRecruit.git
```

### 2. Build a branch from main
- Ensures that any changes you are making will be self-contained on the same branch and not affect the main branch.
- Any conflict resolution is possible before merging.
- Additionally, it acts as a type of versioning allowing us to go back and restore if anything happens to the main.
```
git checkout -b my-branch-name
```

### 3. Enviroment Variables Configuration 
- Download env.dev & env.local files from Google Drive
- Place env.dev in the SmartRecruit/backend directory.
- Place env.local in the SmartRecruit/frontend directory.
- Edit the file to include the period at the front of "env.dev" --> ".env.dev" and you will notice the file will be greyed out indicated it is successfully flagged by .gitignore.

### 4. Running the Frontend
We will be using Next.js for our frontend, running this is very simple compared to the backend.
  
- Change the directory to the frontend
```
cd frontend
```

- Installing Modules
```
npm i
```

- Running the Development Environment
```
npm run dev
```

### 5. Running the Backend
We will be using Docker and Docker Compose to build the necessary services to run the backend of our application.

- Change the directory to the backend
```
cd backend
```

- Build an image based on the Dockerfile found in the path associated with build (and then run a container based on that image).
```
docker-compose build
```

- Rebuild an image.
```
docker-compose up --build
```

- Running the image
```
docker-compose up
```

- I recommend using this instead as you can run the image but still add commands after (think of the d as detached)
```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Shutting down the image.
```
docker-compose down
```

- Migration (if there is any changes to the database schema / model)
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
```

- Creating new models (most likely won't have to use this as I will have all the models created already)
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp my-new-model-name
```

- Create superuser (admin portal where you can put data into the models)
```
docker exec -it backend-web-1 python manage.py createsuperuser
```

1. Example:
   - Email: test@test.com
   - Name: Test
   - Password: test12345

- To sign in and use this please access: localhost:8000/admin/.

### 6. Deployment
- The web application is deployed on a Digital Ocean Droplet (i.e. instance, server) with the help of :
   - nginx for reverse proxy, load balancing, mapping to server/media/static file locations and HTTP caching.
   - gunicorn for the webserver gateway interface (wsgi).
   - node.js to extend use of js to server side.
- The current specs for the droplet is: / 4 GB Memory / 25 GB Disk / SYD1 - Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) x64.

Here are some useful deployment commands that was used in the production process: 
#### 6.1. Backend
- Login into the server 
```
ssh root@170.64.172.207
```

- Change directory to webapps folder where the SmartRecruit application is stored
```
cd /webapps
```

- Reboot server
```
reboot
```

- Linux package updates
```
apt update
```

- Upgrade the updates
```
apt upgrade
```

- Install docker on server
```
apt install docker-compose
```

- Clone Repository on server
```
git clone https://github.com/sangvo235/SmartRecruit.git
```

- Add env files (located in this week 11 directory of the team's Google Drive)
- Remember to remove add the . at the front and place it in the correct folder i.e. /backend (for .env.dev) and /frontend (for .env)

- Docker builds (same as previously but different file now)
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

- Creating superuser on server
```
docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Clearing docker images that are not in use
```
docker image ls
docker image prune
```

- Required if using django admin in production as there is an error in relation to the routing and css styling of the admin.
```
docker-compose python manage.py collectstatic
```

#### 6.1. Frontend
- Install node.js for Node.js 20 LTS on Ubuntu 22.04 by following the first 2 steps on:
```
https://medium.com/@nsidana123/before-the-birth-of-of-node-js-15ee9262110c
```

- Install nginx (this is not required previously as it is already apart of the docker file in the backend)
```
apt install nginx
```

- Remove default and add frontend.conf to server
```
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/# rm default
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/# nano frontend.conf
```

- Restart nginx
```
sudo service nginx restart
```

- Build the Next.js app
```
npm run build
```

- Start the Next.js app
```
npm start
```

### 7. Recommendations
- If your using VSCode you can install the following which will help in streamlining the coding process.

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
   - Uniform code formatter.

2. [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
   - Free after verifying with your Swinburne email.
   - Uses AI to help propagate generic code.
