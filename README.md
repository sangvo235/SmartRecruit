# Software Required 💻
Before starting please have the following installed.

## Python
- [Python3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Node.js
1. All Platforms:
   - Download the LTS version from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js and npm.
2. Alternatively, use nvm:
   - Install `nvm` (Node Version Manager) from [nvm's GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
   - Install Node.js using nvm with the command `nvm install 20.9`.

## Docker
1. Windows/macOS:
   - Install Docker Desktop from the [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
   - Docker Compose is included in Docker Desktop.
2. Linux:
   - Install Docker using the official guide from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
   - Install Docker Compose separately following the instructions on the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Git (for version control)
1. Windows:
   - Download Git from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
2. macOS:
   - Install Git using Homebrew with the command `brew install git` in the terminal.
   - If you don't have Homebrew, install it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
3. Linux:
   - Use the package manager to install Git, for example `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian/Ubuntu.

## IDE
- Recommended IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## .env.dev file
- Access to the .env.dev file found in the Team's Google Drive

# Running the Application 👨‍🚀
Follow the following steps to get the application up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

```
git clone git@github.com:sangvo235/SmartRecruit.git
```

### 2. Enviroment Variables Configuration 
- Download env.dev file from Google Drive
- Place in the following directory SmartRecruit/backend.
- Edit the file to include the period at the front of "env.dev" --> ".env.dev" and you will notice the file will be greyed out indicated it is successfully flagged by .gitignore.

### 3. Running the Frontend
We will be using Next.js for our frontend, running this is very simple compared to the backend.
  
- Change the directory to the frontend
```
cd frontend
```

- Installing Modules
```
npm i
```

- Running the Development Environment
```
npm run dev
```

### 3. Running the Backend
We will be using Docker and Docker Compose to build the necessary services to run the backend of our application.

- Change the directory to the backend
```
cd backend
```

- Build an image based on the Dockerfile found in the path associated with build (and then run a container based on that image).
```
docker-compose build
```

- Rebuild an image.
```
docker-compose up --build
```

- Running the image
```
docker-compose up
```

- I recommend using this instead as you can run the image but still add commands after (think of the d as detached)
```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Shutting down the image.
```
docker-compose down
```

- Migration (if there is any changes to the database schema / model)
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
```

- Creating new models (most likely won't have to use this as I will have all the models created already)
```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp XXXXX
```

- Create superuser (admin portal where you can put data into the models)
```
docker exec -it backend-web-1 python manage.py createsuperuser
```

1. Example:
   - Email: test@test.com
   - Name: Test
   - Password: test12345

- To sign in and use this please access: localhost:8000/admin/.
